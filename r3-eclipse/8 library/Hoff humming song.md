Determined to test your new power, you take a second mushroom. At first, everything is blurry, but you remember the humming from last time. Once you get the slow, soothing song just right, you are back in harmony with everything.

You enter the circlevator and punch in number 8. Moments later, the door opens to a vast area of buildings, some clearly modern human laboratories and observatories, others with the familiar circular shape of the temples your clan dedicates to meditation.

With scholars and students alike wandering about, the campus is a hive of activity. Your class is in one of the datarooms, designed to search every aspect of human knowledge. 

**Dot and Shadow are here.**

A drone is following Dot. It has yellow and orange stars painted on the side.

As the lecture begins, your professor is discussing the strategies that can be used to effectively navigate through the complexities of academic research. You are overwhelmed by the galaxy of interconnected nodes, each a topic of study and discovery. The most recent ones are related to Jupiter, the giant planet that is fixed in the sky.

The lesson is rich with insights into hypothesis formulation, data collection, and the importance of peer review. The campus' collaborative spirit is evident, with emphasis on using the various labs available to students.

**Unlocked: You can return to Area 8 and attempt a scientific discovery.**

The lesson feels a little rushed. It seems that the teacher wanted to be on the observation deck during the eclipse that is starting now and will last an hour.

Instead, you take the opportunity to look at the rounded buildings. These humans seem to have reused them as laboratories, and while they could still be used for meditation by turning off all the machines, you no longer need quiet rooms for that. 

MEDITATION

This time there were also 3 presences that you could feel. The strong one was Alice for sure, and the other two could be other students. You are wondering if they can sense you.

Back in your room, a drone brings you a new mushroom. How... did she know?
