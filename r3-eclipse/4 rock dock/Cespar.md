You use the circlevator to visit area 4. As the door opens, the air around you forms a white cloud as it freezes, and your skin and eyes get colder before your suit automatically forms a protective mask over your face. The atmosphere of this moon is thin and too cold to hold any water.

**Word is here.**

The dock is a large area of the station's ring, with drones flying in and out of huge containers. All the containers are labeled and connected to processing units that appear to be breaking rocks into smaller pieces. You also notice a display on the drones that shows a 0 when they go out and a 4 when they come back.

You follow a group of students into one of the buildings. The noise of machines fills the air. Inside, you meet Professor Nekane, an elderly but strong woman. "Welcome," she begins, gesturing to the collection in front of her. "Today we're going to study the unique geological formations created by meteorite impacts on Callisto. These include not only impact diamonds, but also pallasites with embedded olivine crystals, and tektites, which are glassy rocks formed from the debris of meteoric impacts."

Throughout the class, she shows you how to use the equipment to analyze these exotic materials, explaining the science behind their origins and what they can tell us about the history of this landscape. At the end of the lesson, you are encouraged to choose a gem or rock to analyze further. "Pick one to continue your study in a lab", she suggests. You look forward to unlocking its secrets.

**You gain: A crystal of pyrite**

For an hour, the sun hid behind the planet and everything was pitch black except for the dim lights of the drones. You can see the stars more clearly and notice that the drones all go to and return from the same hole. When the sun comes back to light up the landscape, you can't tell which one of the craters they're going into.

Back in your room, your drone awaits with no new items for you from area 3.
