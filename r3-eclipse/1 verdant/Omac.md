You enter the circlevator, set your destination to Area 1, and are carried swiftly around the station's ring. As the doors slide open, you're greeted by the vibrant scenery of a jungle. You find a class about to begin, surrounded by the rich, earthy scent of damp leaves.

The teacher, Professor Luzia, gathers everyone and begins to lead the group deeper into the jungle. She points out various plants, noting that they all originate from Earth. From time to time, she gives you a curious look that makes you wonder if she will ask for an autograph later.

For an hour the sun hides behind the planet and this area becomes pitch black except for the UV lamps in some greenhouses.

As the class draws to a close, Professor Luzia extends an invitation to everyone. "Next time, bring your own vials, like the one Omac has been using to make music", she points out. "We'll be exploring how to extract and combine these plants into more complex products. I'll provide the secondary ingredients."

**Unlocked: Professor Luzia can create potions if you give her the main component and a vial.**

You leave the area, fascinated by the plants and wondering what components could be used for the healing potion. Your fans and followers seem upset because nobody was naked.
