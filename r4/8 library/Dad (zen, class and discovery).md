Determined to test your new power, you take the mushroom. At first, everything is blurry, but you remember the humming from last time. Once you get the slow, soothing song just right, you are back in harmony with everything. You feel the presence of Alice, but none of the other ones from before.

**You lose: Blue mushroom.**

You enter the circlevator and punch in number 8. Moments later, the door opens to a vast area of buildings, some clearly modern human laboratories and observatories, others with the familiar circular shape of the temples your clan dedicates to meditation. With scholars and students alike wandering about, the campus is a hive of activity.

**Shadow, MMLH and Dot are here.**

A drone is following Dot. It has yellow and orange stars painted on the side. Shadow and her can access the campus, while you and MMLH need to attend class first.

Your class is in one of the datarooms, designed to search every aspect of human knowledge. As the lecture begins, your professor is discussing the strategies that can be used to effectively navigate through the complexities of academic research. You are amazed by the galaxy of interconnected nodes, each a topic of study and discovery, but interconnected. The most recent ones are related to Jupiter, the giant planet that is fixed in the sky.

The lesson is rich with insights into hypothesis formulation, data collection, and the importance of peer review. The campus' collaborative spirit is evident, of unity, with emphasis on using the various labs available to students.

HELPING SHADOW

After class, you follow Shadow's scent to find her in a lab, surrounded by an array of bottles filled with dark substances. She looks exhausted, but you know better than to speak your mind, so you praise her meticulous organization.

"Nothing works! It lacks texture!", she exclaims, as she begins a maniacal search of your bag. "This!", she mumbles as she steals your flowers, "this has latex in it!".

**You lose: Plumeria flowers.**

You continue humming your song and look around the lab. Everything seems connected, the earthy smells from the bottles, the dim light from the sun, the stars in Dot's drone, today's lesson, and the fading taste of the mushroom.

Shadow finishes her experiment and submits the draft for peer review, adding your name to it.

**Achieved: Scientific discovery.**
