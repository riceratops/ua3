You follow Dot and her companion drone to the circlevator. Moments later, the door opens to a vast area of buildings, some clearly modern human laboratories and observatories, others with the familiar circular shape of the temples your clan dedicates to meditation. With scholars and students alike wandering about, the campus is a hive of activity. 

**Dot, Dad and Shadow are here.**

Dot and Shadow have access to the campus, but Dad and you must attend class first. Your class is in one of the datarooms. Dad keeps humming a slow song.

As the lecture begins, your professor is discussing the strategies that can be used to effectively navigate through the complexities of academic research. The lesson is rich with insights into hypothesis formulation, data collection, and the importance of peer review, with emphasis on using the various labs available to students.

NERD BONUS

There are old pictures of scientists on the wall. One of them is of a man holding a potion of the same blue color as your mushroom. Below it is written "Dr. Lereisn".

HELPING DOT

After class, you find Dot in one of those labs, and see that she has already built some kind of detector using her crystal.

Playing with it, directing it at different points inside and outside of the station, and find out that all dark spots in the sky give the same reading, like a residual light from the ionosphere. You draw a line and suggest using it as a base for measurements.  So today's light is ONE of that unit, and you can check if it changes over time.

She loves the idea and submits the draft for peer review, adding your name in it.

**Achieved: Scientific discovery.**
