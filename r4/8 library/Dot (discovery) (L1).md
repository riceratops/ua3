You decide to persevere and return to the labs. With the help of your friends MMLH and Peaches, you are sure to come up with something!

**Peaches, MMLH, Dad and Shadow are here.**

MMLH and Dad need to get access to the campus, so they go talk to the teacher. Dad keeps humming a slow song. Meanwhile, you find a lab with lots of modern equipment. Peaches beeps in agreement.

Sleeping actually helped. Yesterday you were lost in a sea of published papers, but if you narrow down what kind of crystal this is, the search will be easier. You begin by scanning the crystal. It is pure strontium titanate, and its structure is indeed a perovskite. 

Back into the database, you still find a lot of articles, but it is manageable. These crystals have good photoconductivity, and have several applications, one of which piques your interest.

By the time MMLH joins you, you have already built a prototype using the crystal. It has a detector on one side, and a reinforcing ring around it. 

Playing with it, pointing the thing at different points inside and outside of the station, she finds out that all dark spots in the sky give a residual reading from the ionosphere. MMLH suggests calibrating it to today's background light and calling this unit of measurement a "DOT", in honor of its inventor. So today the residual light is ONE DOT. 

You agree, for now, until you can think of a better name. You submit the draft for peer review and include MMLH's name.

**Achieved: Scientific discovery.**

**You gain: Light indicator.**

Despite being a great day, you feel uneasy and grumpy. It's been a while since you've had a break. Perhaps you should skip class tomorrow and relax.
