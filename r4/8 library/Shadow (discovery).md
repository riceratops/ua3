As the teacher said yesterday, science happens at the frontier of knowledge. There are no dead ends, there is no giving up. You will make something beautiful for other artists out of this stupid mud. After a quick breakfast, you go to the campus.

**Dad, MMLH and Dot are here.**

On your way to the labs, you see Dot enter one of them, followed by her drone. Asking around, you are pointed to a crate full of samples from outside. Using your amazing strength, you carry the entire box into a workshop and begin putting dust into flasks of water and classifying the mud by color. You experiment with additives to achieve different consistencies, and you end up with a gradient of blacks and browns.

Time passes and no result. You try them directly for sumi-e, you mix them with oils and try some techniques to achieve hydrochromic properties, but the behavior is are no different than synthetic pigments. You need something organic to interact with water.

You hear Dad humming a slow song and turn around. He smells good, didn't he say that he had flowers? No, it is the flowers that smell. Plumeria, was it? You pick them from his bag and your glove is painted white with its sap. These have latex!

He gladly gives you the collar of flowers and keeps you company. He mentions using light, and you use a laser to alter one of the samples of distilled latex. After some more work, you have a sample of a dark brown pigment that turns pink in contact with water, but does not dilute.

Time to publish the experiment (and to patent it, if the school allows it). It seems natural to include his name on the study when you submit it for peer review.

**Achieved: Scientific discovery.**

**You gain: hydrochromic ink (sepia/orchid pink)**

Despite being a great day, you feel uneasy and grumpy. It's been a while since you've had a break. Perhaps you should skip class tomorrow and relax.
