Stepping into the circlevator, you request Area 2 and feel the gentle hum as the system efficiently transports you around the ring of the station. When you arrive, scene of organized chaos unfolds before you: drones maneuver gracefully in an intricate aerial ballet, and mechanisms interact with seamless precision.

**Omac and Word are here**

A friendly UWU holographic display materializes before you. "Welcome to the Automation Playground, do you consent to biometric identification?". Assuming this is the way to attend class, you nod. The display shows a thumbs up: "Lesson commencing".

The presentation begins, showing how the complexity of the machines comes not from intricate designs, but from the simple, programmable nature of these drones. Following basic rules and predictable patterns, these devices orchestrate an elaborate dance of tasks and functions. Every movement and decision is clearly signaled, creating a harmony that mimics organic precision.

As the lesson ends, one of the drones descends and hovers in front of you. Its lights pulsate softly, indicating that it is in idle mode. The words "Following" shimmer around it. It seems you've acquired a new companion in this playground.

**Unlocked: You gain the ability to send your "pet" drone to any area. It can deliver items to their designated recipients and retrieve items intended for you.**

(It's similar to the one that keeps you stashed of mushrooms, actually)

Your followers didn't seem interested in the machines, but they were entertained by today's collaboration with Omac and you both gain more subscribers!
