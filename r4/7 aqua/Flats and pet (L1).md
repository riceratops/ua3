You request area 7, and the circlevator whisks you around the ring. The door opens onto an aquamarine expanse of islands surrounded by vibrant coral and algae.

Your drone pet follows you here, but awaits for you at the entrance.

It's an environment devoted entirely to aquatic flora. The waves are gigantic due to the low gravity, which already seems to be wreaking havoc. From time to time, large spheres of water cross the room and bounce off the dome.

To move around, Instructor Molpe recommends that students wear the mermaid suits provided. When you put yours on, you feel uncomfortable and can't wait to take it off. Besides, if this silly little instructor can swim without one, you certainly won't need one.

Anyway, you learn about the qualities of various aquatic plants, from decorative water lilies to microscopic phytoplankton, and how the sunlight on this moon is too dim for any of them to grow healthy. Quite uneventful.

There are empty vials at the exit gate, you take one.

**You gain: empty vial**

Surprisingly, your fans were amused by this area and the mermaid suits. You don't think they noticed, but you feel uneasy and grumpy, probably because of the cold bath. It's been a while since you've had a break, and perhaps you could skip class and relax next round.
