Today the background light is between 3 and 4 Dots.

Then, you try to meditate with Peaches, but you can't walk and meditate at the same time. You try the Zenphony, but it doesn't seem to work without a mushroom.

You give up trying to meditate like this, step into the circlevator and punch number 5, Muckworks. The ride over is quick, and when the doors open, you're hit with a strong, earthy smell. Unlike your classmates who wrinkle their noses, you find the scent oddly comforting.

**Peaches, Flats and another drone are here.**

Flats separates from the group, looking for something. He knows his way around. The drone doesn't follow Flats and is constantly making chicken noises. You recognize it from when it was with Cespar. In fact, now it has Cespar's purple feathers glued to it and drawings on the front to make the beak more realistic. Peaches beeps to you, sad.

Dr. Harlow, wearing a clean lab coat, greets everyone with a serious look. Reading the room, she gets right to the point, explaining the manure processing system with a straightforward approach. As she walks you through the facility, she details how this recycling operation is vital for the station's sustainability.

You're more engaged than the others, who seem eager to get away from the smell. Dr. Harlow talks about how they turn waste into something useful, and you appreciate the importance of recycling in maintaining life on the station.

At the end of the tour, Dr. Harlow shows off some blue vials on a shelf. These are made from byproducts and help keep the conducts clean.

While your classmates hurry out, you take a moment to look at the vials more closely. These are the potions MMLH mentioned.

**You gain: A blue potion**

The other drone is still at the exit, making chicken noises. You open it with your master key to see what's inside, but it's empty. However, you can now access the programming panel, so you make it follow you from now on.

**You now have 2 drones.**

Back in your room with your two friends, you notice that the attendance for area 1 is marked. Did someone impersonate you in the groove?

**Achievement: You (apparently) attended all 8 lessons.**
