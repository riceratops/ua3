You write the letter and send it to Alice in area 6, along with your potion. 

**You lose: Healing potion.**

Your fans react to your comment about not seeking adoration. They do adore you and your commentary when you broadcast the lessons. They will miss those days.

You leave your room munching the mushroom and humming the song. Back to the Muckworks.

**Dot is here.**

A drone follows Dot. It has yellow and orange stars painted on its side. Another drone remains at the entrance, making chicken noises. It has purple feathers glued to it and a rudimentary beak.

While the group attends the Doctor's lesson, you explore the area on your own. There are labs with equipment for analyzing samples, channels of clean water, pipes, and waterfalls of dubious brown, green and blue colors.

All this time you have been meditating. You feel presences. So many you can't count. There are three stronger ones, they merge with you and calm you, but you are so overwhelmed that you simply stare at the water for a while.

On your last visit you learned that they make potions from recycled materials, so you follow a pipe of blue liquid until you find where the blue potions are made.

**You gain: A healing potion.**

Dr. Harlow surprises you. "Don't take too many, I want to send them to the Seer Pencilvia". 

You ask her if Pencilvia is Alice, and if so, why can't she cook the mushrooms herself? She smiles. "That's a good question. As it turns out, the production of mushrooms is not enough for the needs of the current operations. We used to just have to keep this station clean, but now they need more. Anyway, we are closing."

Your fans brainstorm with theories. What are they cleaning? Or... what are they healing?

When you return to your room, the drone is waiting for you, reporting a successful delivery. It also has a new mushroom inside. You check your personal progress to confirm that you have finished all of the tasks.

**Achieved: Delivered Healing potion to Seer Pencilvia.**
