You are still connected to the others. You recognize them. But this time, there are many, many other presences. You sense Alice and Dad, strong as ever. The three of you seem to be in control, but the others are not. For example, Flats is eating a mushroom in the Muckworks, and through his eyes you see Dot. Through Omac's eyes you see Hoff and MMLH in the Xeno Garden. Despite their constant consumption of mushrooms, they still don't seem to recognize you.

You are one with The Harmony, you no longer need to concentrate to feel the presences, and meditation is a thing of the past. You explore the common area with your drone, making friends with the janitors and even some of the second year students.

Even though you are disconnected from school activities, someone has been impersonating you. Your attendance sheet says that you were in areas 1 and 7, and that the Seer Pencilvia received your healing potion.
