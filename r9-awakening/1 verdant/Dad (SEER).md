You are still connected to the others. You recognize them. But this time, there are many, many other presences. You sense Alice and Word, strong as ever. The three of you seem to be in control, but the others are not. For example, Flats is eating a mushroom in the Muckworks, and through his eyes you see Dot. Through Omac's eyes you see Hoff and MMLH in the Xeno Garden. Despite their constant consumption of mushrooms, they still don't seem to recognize you.

There are hundreds of others. When you merge with them, you feel calm and silence, but see nothing but darkness. Who are they, why didn't you sense them before, and where are they?

While you were experiencing all this, you went on with your day. You placed the potion in your drone's container and programmed the delivery for Pen in Area 9.

**You lose: Healing Potion.

You enter the circlevator, set your destination to Area 1, and are carried swiftly around the station's ring. As the doors slide open, you're greeted by the vibrant scenery of a jungle. You find a class about to begin, surrounded by the rich, earthy scent of damp leaves.

**Shadow is here.**

Shadow growls in pain as her bones snap and realign. She transforms into her feral form. The students around her gasp in amazement at her long ears, beautiful form, and soft dark fur. "Soo cool! Soo fluffy!". Ashamed, as she should be for transforming, she runs off into the wilderness.

The teacher, Professor Luzia, gathers everyone and begins to lead the group deeper into the jungle. She points out various plants, noting that they all originate from Earth. From time to time, she gives you a curious look that makes you feel a little self-conscious. You notice that Shadow has rejoined the group. She has found a large log and is carrying it as she tries to follow the lesson.

As the class draws to a close, Professor Luzia extends an invitation to everyone. "Next time, bring your own vials, like Dad did", she instructs. "We'll be exploring how to extract and combine these plants into more complex products. I'll provide the secondary ingredients."

**Unlocked: Visit area 1 again with a vial and the main component of a potion.**

PRETTY BONUS

A group of students, who have apparently been picking up various flowers, approach you. Blushing, they offer you an arrangement of them. There is a note with their room numbers.

Meanwhile, Shadow is growling at the teacher, demanding explanations. Apparently there is an operation going on outside on the surface. "Look, there is no need for violence.", she says, shaking. "I don't know why Pencilvia needs so many potions out there. They are probably cleaning pipes, unless they found another use for them."

Shadow grabs her log of wood and storms back to the circlevator. As she walks away, the Luzia composes herself again. "That's it, I don't want to see you beasts again. I'm going to tell them that you all took this class".

When you return to your room, the drone is waiting for you, reporting a successful delivery. You check your personal progress to confirm that you have finished all of the tasks.

**Achieved: Delivered Healing potion to Seer Pencilvia.**

**Achieved: Attended the 8 lessons.**
