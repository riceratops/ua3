This morning you feel grumpy and uncomfortable, itching all over your legs and arms. Also, it's been a while since you last meditated, perhaps that's it.

You are angry at everything. If it wasn't for its purpose, you would smash that annoying drone against the wall. You place two potions in its container, with a note explaining that one is from Word, and program the delivery to Pen. You also place Omac's rock so that they won't catch you with it, and press number 9.

**You lose: 2 blue potions, Omac's pallasite.**

You use the annoyingly slow Circlevator to reach Area 1. As the doors slide open, you're greeted by the vibrant scenery of a jungle. You find a class about to begin, surrounded by the rich, earthy scent of damp leaves. The teacher, Professor Luzia, gathers everyone and begins to lead the group deeper into the jungle. 

The unexpected mix of scents made you lose control. You growl uncontrollably and stretch your arms and legs, the annoying itch from before turning to pleasure as you grow hair everywhere. Your bones creak audibly as they realign and you transform into your feral form. You are the shame of your clan and as far from their teachings as one can get.

**You are in Feral Form.**

**Dad is here.**

PRETTY BONUS

The students around you gasp in amazement at your long ears and dark fur. "Soo cool! Soo fluffy!".

While paying attention to the teacher, you separate from the group, taste every plant and stick your snout in every pot. The excitement of exploring these distractions is palpable. Then you see it. Under a row of tall trees you see a long piece of wood. It is simply perfect, and it is now yours.

**You gain: The perfect stick.**

FERAL BONUS

The class is ending and Professor Luzia is talking about potions. You ask her where Pen is and wha what the potions are for, but you are too angry to ask politely. "It's for the operation they're running in Area 0", she says, shaking. You fiddle with the stick, thinking of the trail of drones you saw.

"Look, there is no need for violence. I don't know why Pencilvia needs so many potions out there. They are probably cleaning pipes, unless they found another use for them."

You nod to thank her and head back to your room. As you leave, she says. "That's it, I don't want to see you beasts again. I'm going to tell them that you all took this class".

When you return to your room, the drone is waiting for you, reporting a successful delivery. She took everything, including the rock. You check your personal progress to confirm that you have finished the task. 

**Achieved: Delivered Healing potion to Seer Pencilvia.**

Well, this confirms that these blue potions are the correct ones. Hopefully, it also counted for Word.
