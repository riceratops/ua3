This morning you feel even more grumpy and uncomfortable. It's been a while since you last meditated, perhaps that's it.

You send your creation to Area 5, hoping they will confuse it with you and it will count for attendance. If that works, you can relax tomorrow.

Stepping into the circlevator, you request area 7, and it whisks you quickly around the ring. The door opens onto an aquamarine expanse of islands and surrounded by vibrant coral and algae.

It's an environment dedicated to aquatic flora. The waves are gigantic due to the low gravity, which already seems to be wreaking havoc. Large spheres of water cross the room and bounce off the dome, and drops of salty water hit you in the face.

To move around, Instructor Molpe recommends that students wear the mermaid suits provided. Apparently, they don't have suits that fit your needs, and that makes you angry. So angry.

You growl uncontrollably and stretch your wings and legs, the annoying itch from before turning to pleasure as you grow hair everywhere. Your bones creak audibly as they realign and you transform into your feral form, with claws at the end of the wings. You are the shame of your clan and as far from their teachings as one can get.

**You are in Feral Form.**

PRETTY BONUS
 
The students around you gasp in amazement at your muscles and purple fur. "Soo cool! Soo fluffy!". Molpe gives you a plumeria flower necklace. "Here, now you look even better".

**You gain: plumeria flowers**

FERAL BONUS

Confused, you let her put it in your neck, but then you push her, angry at the situation.

"We once had a student with the same anger management problems.", she explained. "It was her curse, or so she thought, and one day she drank one of those blue potions. After that, she was able to control her anger and still show her stronger self."

You had enough. This little woman is telling you to drink a potion that you no longer have. You don't need a potion, you just need to meditate like you've been taught to do all your life. To abandon your feral side. You push her again and leave.

You hear her saying. "That's rude, I don't want to see your kind again. I'm going to tell them that you all have attended this class".

You return to your room and check your progress. It says that you have one task left: Attend the class in Area 5.

Your drone has not returned.
