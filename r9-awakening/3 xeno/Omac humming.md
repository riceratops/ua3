Hoping that Flats is right, you put the potion and your autograph in Steven's container and send it to Alice. Your fans wave goodbye. One of them says that the first "e" is not silent, so you ban him.

**You lose: Blue potion.**

You wish you had another drone to send things to Shadow, but you don't know where she is at, nor do you have a way to return her stuff.

You leave your room munching the mushroom and humming the song.

Next, the circlevator takes you quickly to the Xeno Garden, where a special kind of biology is studied. These organisms resemble plants, but their cells are nothing like plants, and they are all purple because they share a common ancestor.

**MMLH and Hoff are here.**

Then it kicks. You feel presences. So many you can't count. There are three stronger ones, they merge with you and calm you, but you are so overwhelmed that you can barely follow the group of students in front of you.

The Xeno Garden is full of warnings. Do not touch, do not inhale, do not do anything. Miss Edurne, the old teacher who welcomes the students here, repeats the warnings and adds, "There used to be a hands-on session as part of this course, but a student got hurt". 

All the samples were behind transparent walls. They really did look like plants, but a plant would not thrive in lava or frozen methane, so the whole visit challenges your understanding of evolution. The last lesson before leaving is an exhibit of an organism with tongue-like leaves that dance to music. They were discovered by Pencilvia half a century ago.

As you approach, they dance to the music of Zenphony. Miss Edurne smiles. "They love this song, we are not quite sure why."

MMLH asks her if Alice and Pen are the same person. "You're one of the smart ones, aren't you?", she says.

POPULAR BONUS

When MMLH leaves, Hoff asks Miss Edurne about the song. 

"You could say that Pencilvia composed the rhythm, but what really happened is that she studied the dancing petals and what sounds resonated with them. The resulting notes are the Zenphony song as you know it".

Your fans brainstorm with theories. One of them says that Hoff is Pen, so you ban him for not paying attention.

When you return to your room, the drone is waiting for you, reporting a successful delivery. It also has a new mushroom inside. You check your personal progress to confirm that you have finished all of the tasks.

**Achieved: Delivered Healing potion to Seer Pencilvia.**

**Achieved: Attended the 8 lessons.**
