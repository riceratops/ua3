Hoping that your friends are right, you place the healing potion in the drone and tell it to give it to Alice.

**You lose: Healing potion.**

Next, the circlevator takes you quickly to the Xeno Garden, where a special kind of biology is studied. These organisms resemble plants, but their cells are nothing like plants, and they are all purple because they share a common ancestor.

**MMLH and Omac are here.**

Omac is eating a mushroom and humming the song. He seems distracted by what he's sensing, but follows the group quietly.

The Xeno Garden is full of warnings. Do not touch, do not inhale, do not do anything. Miss Edurne, the old teacher who welcomes the students here, repeats the warnings and adds, "There used to be a hands-on session as part of this course, but a student got hurt". 

All the samples were behind transparent walls. They really did look like plants, but a plant would not thrive in lava or frozen methane, so the whole visit challenges your understanding of evolution. The last lesson before leaving is an exhibit of an organism with tongue-like leaves that dance to music. They were discovered by Pencilvia half a century ago.

As Omac approaches, they dance to the song. Miss Edurne smiles. "They love this song, we are not quite sure why."

MMLH asks her if Alice and Pen are the same person. "You're one of the smart ones, aren't you?", she says.

POPULAR BONUS

When MMLH leaves, you ask Miss Edurne about the song. 

"You could say that Pencilvia composed the rhythm, but what really happened is that she studied the dancing petals and what sounds resonated with them. The resulting notes are the Zenphony song as you know it".

Your fans rejoice . Could the teachers be any more obvious about who Pen is?

When you return to your room, the drone is waiting for you, reporting a successful delivery. You check your personal progress to confirm that you have finished all of the tasks.

**Achieved: Delivered Healing potion to Seer Pencilvia.**

**Achieved: Attended the 8 lessons.**
