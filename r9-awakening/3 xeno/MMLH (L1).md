To test your theory, you send your last potion to Alice in area 6. 

**You lose: A healing potion.**

You feel uneasy and grumpy. It's been a while since you've had a break, but you want to attend class.

The circlevator takes you quickly to the Xeno Garden, where a special kind of biology is studied. These organisms resemble plants, but their cells are nothing like plants, and they are all purple because they share a common ancestor.

**Hoff and Omac are here.**

Omac is humming the meditation song. He seems distracted by what he's sensing, but follows the group quietly.

The Xeno Garden is full of warnings. Do not touch, do not inhale, do not do anything. Miss Edurne, the old teacher who welcomes the students here, repeats the warnings and adds, "There used to be a hands-on session as part of this course, but a student got hurt". 

You check your remote switch. You could turn off any of these containers, but you don't imagine how dangerous that would be.

All the samples were behind transparent walls. They really did look like plants, but a plant would not thrive in lava or frozen methane, so the whole visit challenges your understanding of evolution. The last lesson before leaving is an exhibit of an organism with tongue-like leaves that dance to music. They were discovered by Pencilvia half a century ago.

As Omac approaches, they dance to the song. Miss Edurne smiles. "They love this song, we are not quite sure why."

You ask her if Alice and Pen are the same person. "You're one of the smart ones, aren't you?", she compliments you, but doesn't really answer the question.

When you return to your room, the drone is waiting for you, reporting a successful delivery. You check your personal progress to confirm that you have finished all of the tasks.

**Achieved: Delivered Healing potion to Seer Pencilvia.**

**Achieved: Attended the 8 lessons.**
