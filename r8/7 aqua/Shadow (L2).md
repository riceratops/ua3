This morning you feel grumpy and uncomfortable, itching all over your legs and arms. It's been a while since you last meditated, but there's no time and you rather make them pay for robbing you.

You configure your drone to say that it belongs to Pen, and send it to area 5. Nobody will expect that.

After a quick breakfast, you go to area 7. The circlevator whisks you around the ring. The door opens onto an aquamarine expanse of islands surrounded by vibrant coral and algae.

**Hoff and her drone are here, humming some song.**

That's the same song Dad was singing in the lab. Speaking of Dad, his drone flies in with a delivery for you. It doesn't look like Hoff recognized the rock, but this was quite the shady move.

**You gain: A huge pallasite, A blue potion**

This is an environment devoted entirely to aquatic flora. The waves are gigantic due to the low gravity, which already seems to be wreaking havoc. From time to time, large spheres of water cross the room and bounce off the dome.

To move around, Instructor Molpe recommends that students wear the mermaid suits provided. When you put yours on, you feel uncomfortable and can't wait to take it off. Besides, if this silly little instructor can swim without one, you certainly won't need one.

Anyway, you learn about the qualities of various aquatic plants, and how they can't manage to grow them healthy in here. Quite pathetic.

BONUS FOR BEING PRETTY

Eventually, you ditch the cumbersome mermaid suit and try to get around without it. You dive deep into the water, touch the bottom, and swim up so fast that you end up flying, cutting one of the bubbles in half and punching the ceiling of the dome before diving back in. Your classmates applaud, but Molpe is worried that you hit the dome too hard. "Please stay here, I didn't like how that sounded", she says. Leaving her attendance sheet on a table, she jumps onto a medusa-shaped drone, which she uses to reach the spot up there where you struck.

Seizing the opportunity, you grab the sheet. It is some kind of human device in which you select your user name. You'll be in trouble if you break or steal it, so you simply copy the list of users who seem to have used it before. 

By the time Molpe comes down in her medusa, you are innocently playing with a vial. She tells you that everything is fine and you can keep the vial. "Thanks for taking my class!"

**You gain: Empty vial, List of user names**

Here's the list of usernames you took: 

    ```
	CAPEDURNE
    LUZIEVIZA
    MATT12345
    MOLPEDUSA
    NALICEVIP
    SNEKANEVA
    UWUOS0002
    VPHHARLOW
    ```

When you return to your room, your drone reports that it has recovered your items. You pick them up and, realizing what just happened, start laughing uncontrollably, your voice deep and feral.

**You gain: 2 more blue potions, 2 notes from students**

The notes read:

"From MMLH to Pen: Here is my potion. My hope is that we can finally meet at the graduation ceremony. Thanks!"

"I would have preferred to give this more personal autograph to you, my wonderful fan Seer Pen, in person, but I must continue progression towards my teamâ€™s success. Sincerely, Flats."
