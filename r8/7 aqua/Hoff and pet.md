It takes a while, but eating the mushroom calms your mind and helps you regain control. Your bones realign and you go return to your normal form. By the time you join the other students for breakfast, your face, arms, and legs are furless. 

**You lose (for now): a mushroom**

You step into the "circlevator" and push number 7. The machine quickly whisks you around the ring, and the door opens onto an aquamarine expanse of islands surrounded by vibrant coral and algae.

It's an environment devoted entirely to aquatic flora, with no fish or other animals in sight. The waves are gigantic due to the low gravity, which already seems to be wreaking havoc. From time to time, large spheres of water cross the room and bounce off the dome. Your drone beeps, frightened, and waits for you at the entrance.

**Shadow is here.**

She looks uncomfortable and keeps scratching her arms. You know how this will end. A drone arrives with a delivery for her and she picks a rock and a Healing potion from it.

To move around, Instructor Molpe recommends that students wear the mermaid suits provided. You put yours on and start moving your cute tail to the rhythm of your song. Your follower count goes up so fast!

Anyway, you learn about the qualities of various aquatic plants, from decorative water lilies to microscopic phytoplankton, and how the sunlight on this moon is too dim for any of them to grow healthy.

There are empty vials at the exit gate, you grab one just in case. 

When you return to your room, Alice's drone is waiting for you with a new mushroom.

**You gain: empty vial, blue mushroom**
