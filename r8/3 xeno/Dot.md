As is now routine, you check the background light of the atmosphere. It reads a little over 5. 

Then you put the mushroom in your mouth. You start to feel nauseous, but when you start humming the song, you feel better. You can now meditate and be a functional student at the same time. 

Before leaving the room, you trust Peaches with all of your belongings and send her away.

**You lose: Blue Mushroom, Master key, Light indicator, Empty vial**

The circlevator takes you quickly to the Xeno Garden, where a special kind of biology is studied. These organisms resemble plants, but their cells are nothing like plants, and they are all purple because they share a common ancestor.

**Dad is here.**

You feel Dad's presence very strongly, just like Alice did when you learned this trick. Maybe the mushrooms don't affect him.

You concentrate on the song while you wait for the teacher, looking deep into your mind, then into the Harmony. You feel FIVE presences. Three of them are stronger. They move in and out of your mind, like explorers, and you know that one of them is Dad, who is here, following the teacher just like you do. Another of the presences must be Alice, but who are the other three? You focus and try to think of Pen, to ask them about her, but that doesn't seem to work.

The Xeno Garden is full of warnings. Do not touch, do not inhale, do not do anything. Miss Edurne, the old teacher who welcomes the students here, repeats the warnings and adds, "There used to be a hands-on session as part of this course, but a student got hurt". 

All the samples were behind transparent walls. They really did look like plants, but a plant would not thrive in lava or frozen methane, so the whole visit challenges your understanding of evolution. The last lesson before leaving is an exhibit of an organism with tongue-like leaves that dance to music. They were discovered by Pencilvia half a century ago.

When you approach, they dance to the song of Zenphony. Miss Edurne smiles. "See? They love that rhythm."

You ask about Pen's whereabouts, but Miss Edurne simply winks and gives you a sterilised vial.

**You gain: another empty vial**

Back in your room, Peaches reports that she didn't find you in 9. You pick your items.

**You recover: Master key, Light indicator, Empty vial**

(Note: you now have 2 vials)
