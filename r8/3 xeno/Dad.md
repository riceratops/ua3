You put the rock and one of the potions in the drone's container and send it to Shadow in area 7. You enter her name and, as soon as you press the number 7, it closes and flies away.

**You lose: A blue potion, Omac's rock**

The circlevator takes you quickly to the Xeno Garden, where a special kind of biology is studied. These organisms resemble plants, but their cells are nothing like plants, and they are all purple because they share a common ancestor.

**Dot is here, humming the Zenphony song.**

You don't need to eat mushrooms or make any effort to feel FIVE presences. You still can't merge with Alice, but you feel the mind of Dot, who is with you in this area. You also see Flats, who is in the Muckworks with MMLH, and Hoff, who is in the Aquaflora with Shadow. None of them recognize you. 

Another strong presence appears, it is Word. You allow her to merge with you and see her meditating outside the station, sitting on the cold surface.

The Xeno Garden is full of warnings. Do not touch, do not inhale, do not do anything. Miss Edurne, the old teacher who welcomes the students here, repeats the warnings and adds, "There used to be a hands-on session as part of this course, but a student got hurt". 

All the samples were behind transparent walls. They really did look like plants, but a plant would not thrive in lava or frozen methane, so the whole visit challenges your understanding of evolution. The last lesson before leaving is an exhibit of an organism with tongue-like leaves that dance to music. They were discovered by Pencilvia half a century ago.

When Dot approaches them, they react to the song she's humming. Miss Edurne smiles. "See? They love that rhythm."

You ask about Pen's whereabouts, but Miss Edurne simply winks and gives you a sterilised vial.

**You gain: an empty vial**

Your drone is waiting for you later in your room. It happily reports that the delivery to Shadow was successful.

RECAP

You still need to attend class in 1 and deliver a Healing Potion to Seer Pencilvia.

Your inventory: An empty vial, A blue potion
