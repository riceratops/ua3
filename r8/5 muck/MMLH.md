Once again, you send your belongings away using your drone. You tell it to deliver all yourself in area 9.

**You lose (for now): The remote switch, a healing potion.**

You step into the circlevator and punch number 5, Muckworks. The ride over is quick, and when the doors open, you're hit with a strong, earthy smell. Unlike your classmates who wrinkle their noses, you find the scent oddly comforting.

**Flats is here, humming the Zenphony song.**

A drone hovers at the entrance. "Deposit here your deliveries for Pencilvia", it says. But you sent your potion to another area. You now wish you didn't.

Dr. Harlow, wearing a clean lab coat, greets everyone with a serious look. Reading the room, she gets right to the point, explaining the manure processing system with a straightforward approach. As she walks you through the facility, she details how this recycling operation is vital for the station's sustainability.

You're more engaged than the others, who seem eager to get away from the smell. Dr. Harlow talks about how they turn waste into something useful, and you appreciate the importance of recycling in maintaining life on the station.

At the end of the tour, Dr. Harlow shows off some blue vials on a shelf. These are made from byproducts and help keep the conducts clean, or so he says. You pocket one of them because you know that these are healing potions.

**You gain: A healing potion**

Pen's drone is still there, so Flats and you place your potions inside with a note. Yours reads: 

"From MMLH to Pen: Here is my potion. My hope is that we can finally meet at the graduation ceremony. Thanks!"

**You lose: A healing potion**

Back in your room, and just like last time, your drone reports that the delivery was unsuccessful. You recover your things.

**You recover: The remove switch, and a healing potion.**

When you check your student progress, you notice that Pencilvia never confirmed your delivery. Have you been scammed?
