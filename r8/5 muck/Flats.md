You put a mushroom in your mouth and start humming. You are meditating, but you are also a functioning student. Not just functional, but the student who cracks all the secrets. And you have a plan, too. You place your healing potion in Buzzy's container and send it to area 0. "Deliver this to Pencilvia, Buzzy".

**You lose: blue mushroom, healing potion.**

When you look into your mind and then into the Harmony, you feel FIVE presences. Three of them are stronger and you are not sure which one is Alice. You merge with them. Even though you do not know who they are, you appreciate the peace and calm.

Relaxed, you step into the circlevator and punch number 5, Muckworks. The ride over is quick, and when the doors open, you're hit with a strong, earthy smell. Unlike your classmates who wrinkle their noses, you find the scent oddly comforting.

**MMLH is here.**

A drone hovers at the entrance. "Deposit here your deliveries for Pencilvia", it says. But you sent your potion to another area. You now wish you didn't.

Dr. Harlow, wearing a clean lab coat, greets everyone with a serious look. Reading the room, she gets right to the point, explaining the manure processing system with a straightforward approach. As she walks you through the facility, she details how this recycling operation is vital for the station's sustainability.

You're more engaged than the others, who seem eager to get away from the smell. Dr. Harlow talks about how they turn waste into something useful, and you appreciate the importance of recycling in maintaining life on the station.

At the end of the tour, Dr. Harlow shows off some blue vials on a shelf. These are made from byproducts and help keep the conducts clean, or so he says. You pocket one of them because you know that these are healing potions.

**You gain: A healing potion**

Pen's drone is still there, so MMLH and you place potions inside with a note. Yours reads: 

"I would have preferred to give this more personal autograph to you, my wonderful fan Seer Pen, in person, but I must continue progression towards my teamâ€™s success. Sincerely, Flats."

**You lose: A healing potion**

Back in your room there are two drones waiting for you. One is Alice's with a new mushroom, the other is yours. It reports that the delivery was not successful.

**You recover: A healing potion, a blue mushroom**

Your student progress says that Pen didn't receive your potion. Have you been scammed?

**Achievement: You attended all eight lessons!**
