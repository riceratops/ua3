You quickly finish your breakfast and find a quiet place to continue your meditation. You feel that you are close to discovering who these other strong presences were.

You breathe in and out, in and out, looking deep into your mind, then into Harmony. In and out. Someone is lifting you up, but you have more important things to focus on. They activate the airlock.

As you float down to the surface, you see clearly. Your eyes still closed.

This time is different, FIVE powerful presences are manifesting. Two are very strong, just like before. It feels like their energy can't reach you and you are in control. This time around, you control who merges with you, and in return you see what they see.

You merge with the first one. It is Hoff. She is in the Aquaflora Basin with Shadow, humming a song. You separate from her mind and jump to the second one. This is Flats and he is in the Muckworks with MMLH. He is also humming the same song. Next is Dot, who seems to be singing the same song, and you see Dad next to her. They are attending class in an area full of purple life forms.

You then try to merge with Dad's mind. He recognizes you and lets you in. Jumping from Dot to Dad is fun, and you do it a few times. Dad's mind is stronger than the previous ones.

Finally you try to merge with what you think is Alice, but she gently pushes you away.

When you stop meditating, you find yourself sitting outside of the station. Mr. Fluffyface II is waiting for you, beeping. You grab the drone firmly and soon enough you are flying along the dome of the common area. Then the drone makes a violent turn and dives into the tube of the circlevator, then inside the dorm through the gate.
