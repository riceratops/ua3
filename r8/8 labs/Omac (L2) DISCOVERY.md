This morning you feel grumpy and uncomfortable, itching all over your legs and arms. It's been a while since you last meditated.

Before heading to the library, you put the blue potion in Steven's container, set the recipient name to "Pencilvia" and press 0. Your drone flies away with the potion.

**You lose: A blue potion.**

You go to area 8 with the idea of studying the rock. It is not the one you chose, but it is the one you have. Once there, you look for a suitable laboratory.

**Cespar is here.**

Cespar the chicken is looking for his own lab. He is scratching nervously with his beak under his wings.

You find a laboratory with spectroscopic instruments, stone cutters, polishers and microscopes. Just perfect.

You start preparing samples with the cutter and run them through an XRD to see the crystal structure. It turns out that this magnetite is not only dull and boring, but you can't help but think that cutting your other rock would have been much more beautiful. Everything itches, you scratch your legs and your neck.

Then you run the samples through a microscopic analyzer. Boring. And because they are magnetic, they are now stuck inside. Fuck samplers, fuck magnetite. Fuck this and fuck that too. You smash the microscope on the floor.

After some time of throwing things around, you decide to publish an article on the "Uniformity of pure magnetite crystals in Callisto". You don't even bother to proofread it. Everything itches.

**Achievement: Scientific discovery.**

**You lose: Magnetite.**

Back in your room, Steven reports that it was unable to complete the delivery.

**You recover: A blue potion.**

Despite the achievement, you are extremely grumpy. Maybe you should try to relax in the next round.
