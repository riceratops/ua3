You woke up in a bad mood, feeling itchy and irritable. With your beak, you peck and nibble relentlessly under your wings and along your legs, trying to soothe the uncomfortable itch.

You peck on the different buttons and manage to send the drone looking for Pen in area 9.

**You lose: Blue potion.**

You return to the library to continue your research, this time determined to narrow down the studies that are related to biologically enhanced chickens. 

**Omac is here.**

He nervously scratches his arm as he searches for a lab. You find your own and start investigating.

Despite your best efforts, you find no studies about your kind related to this flower. You resent these machines for not adapting to your body. Soon, your anger translates into broken interfaces, which makes you even angrier. Everything itches. 

Looking for a quick way out of this assignment, you devise a 3-step plan to beat the system. You take a memory test at one of the labs. Next, you eat the flower. And finally, you take the memory test again.

**You lose: Cockscomb.**

You then publish a paper on the "Effects of Celosia Argenta on the short-term memory of bioengineered chickens". You don't even proofread it before you publish it.

**Achieved: Scientific discovery** 

Back in your room, your chicken drone is happily reporting a successful delivery. You double check your progress and it is indeed marked as completed.

**Achievement: You delivered a Healing Potion to Seer Pencilvia.**

Despite the achievements, you are extremely grumpy. Maybe you should try to relax in the next round.
