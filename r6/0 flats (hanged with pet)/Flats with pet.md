OUTSIDE

The bullies open the hatch and you are thrown out into the thin atmosphere outside the school.

After a moment that feels painfully cold, your suit activates. A protective mask forms over your face, and you can breathe again. You continue a short, slow fall toward Callisto's surface, and when you touch the ground, the surface crunches softly under your boots. 

You look up at the exterior of the station. It's like a huge wall and you can't see the domes from here. Above you, the planet, its colorful bands filling half of its crescent shape, the other half pitch black. A small crescent is visible against the dark side, like a star that should not be there. The four larger moons, also crescents, draw an imaginary line. 

Around you, the landscape is icy and cratered, dimly lit by the spectacle from above. You grab a bit of the ground. It's icy and crumbles easily in your hand. The small chunks glitter faintly.

**You gain: Some dirt from outside**

You start walking, looking for the way in. That's when your drone companion flies in and follows you. If only you could move around like... hmm...

Gripping the drone tightly, you hit number 1. It beeps and, in an instant, you are flying along the dome of the common area. Then the drone makes a violent turn and dives into the tube of the circlevator. Your arms and feet hurt, your stomach is up your throat, but you are determined.

AREA 1
