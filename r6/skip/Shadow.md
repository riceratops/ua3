With plenty of time left for your tasks, you decide to skip class and stay in the common area after breakfast.

**Word is here.**

It's been a while since your last meditation session, and this quiet moment helps you refocus and recharge, preparing you for the days ahead. You sit next to Word, who is already doing the breathing exercises.

As you look within yourself with your mind, then into the Harmony, as you have been taught all your life, four powerful presences manifest. It feels like their energy is merging with yours. This connection deepens and you become one with them, and you feel that one of them is Word. Then silence.

You feel calm, deeply at peace, as you have never felt before.

After the session, you hang out with Word and draw some sketches of her hugging her drone. You give her one.
