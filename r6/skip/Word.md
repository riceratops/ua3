Not finding any shuttles outside, you decided to come back and tell others about your adventure, give the potion to Dad, have a proper breakfast and relax. After all, you have been feeling a bit shaky since the attack.

RTD said he wanted to get his own drone, so you send yours with the potion to Area 2.

**You lose: Blue potion**

After breakfast, you find a place to meditate away from the main hall. It's been a while since your last meditation session, and this quiet moment helps you refocus and recharge.

**Shadow is here.**

She sits next to you and begins her breathing exercises. As you look within yourself with your mind, then into the Harmony, as you have been taught all your life, four powerful presences manifest. It feels like their energy is merging with yours. This connection deepens and you become one with them, and you recognize Shadow and Alice, the guide who gave you mushrooms. Then silence.

You feel calm, deeply at peace, as you have never felt before.

After the session, your drone comes back, reporting a successful delivery. Shadow masterfully draws some sketches. 

**You gain: A drawing of Mr. Fluffyface II and you.**
