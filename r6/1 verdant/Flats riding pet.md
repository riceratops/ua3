As the doors slide open, you're greeted by the vibrant scenery of a jungle. The face mask retracts, and you let go of the drone. You are greeted by the rich, earthy scent of damp leaves. 

You start broadcasting the lesson. The teacher, Professor Luzia, gathers everyone and begins to lead the group deeper into the jungle. She points out various plants, noting that they all originate from Earth. From time to time, she gives you a curious look.

As you follow along, your attention drifts to the myriad sticks scattered about and the various scents that fill the air. The excitement of exploring these distractions is palpable.

As the class draws to a close, Professor Luzia extends an invitation to everyone. "Next time, bring your own vials", she instructs. "We'll be exploring how to extract and combine these plants into more complex products. I'll provide the secondary ingredients."

**Unlocked: Visit area 1 with a vial and the main component of a potion.**

"Before you go", she stops you, "we can use the mushroom I smell in your bag to make the potion for the assignment". 

You hesitate for a moment. You can get more of these, so you give it to her. She leads you to an enclosed garden where a cauldron bubbles next to a distillation station, equipped with a glass alembic. Drying racks hold an assortment of herbs.

After some rather instructive cooking, she gives you a blue potion.

**You lose: vial and mushroom**

**You gain: A healing potion**

Back in your room, a drone brings you a new mushroom. How... did she know?

**You gain: A blue mushroom**
