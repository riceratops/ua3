This morning you feel grumpy and uncomfortable, itching all over your legs and arms. Perhaps an allergic reaction. Also, it's been a while since you last meditated, but today you're going to do it in a controlled environment. 

You return to the campus with a simple four-step plan: Identify the mushroom, then a brain scan, eat it, and another brain scan. Comparing the scans should be enough of a science project for the stupid assignments anyway. You came here for gardening, not human history.

Since any of the labs will do, you enter one of the familiar circular buildings, find a scanner, and put the mushroom in it. The screen says it is Stropharia caerulea, also known as Bluecap, with a list of related studies submitted by students of this university, all of them related to healing potions. You feel angry, the professor who makes the potions and the one in the cave lied to you, at least by omission, fuck them and fuck this school. And fuck this scanner, and this screen, and this, and this. You start destroying equipment, but it doesn't make you feel any less anxious. Eventually, exhausted, you drop to the floor and begin to sob.

Most of your followers are appalled, but others try to cheer you up by pointing out that, if this is the case, you already have a healing potion! You pull yourself together and try to rescue the mushroom from the havoc you have caused, but it is fried.

You eat it, but it doesn't seem to have the same effect when cooked. It tastes better, actually, but that's it. After verifying that it is not already documented, you decide to submit a short article on the preservation of the bluecap, and go back to your room, where you should get a fresh one. Everything itches now.

**Achieved: Scientific discovery.**
