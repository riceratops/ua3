This morning you feel grumpy. Attacking Omac was fun, but it didn't help you feel better. It's strange because it hasn't been that long since you last meditated.

Stepping into the circlevator, you request Area 2 and feel the annoying hum as the system transports you around the ring of the station. When you arrive, a scene of chaos unfolds before you: drones maneuver all over the place, and mechanisms interacting with irregular rhythms.

**MMLH is here.**

The nerd looks uncomfortable. Perhaps the noises in this place are affecting her too. One of the drones approaches, it must be Word's. "Delivery for RTD". You open the container and pick the potion inside.

**You gain: another blue potion.**

A friendly UWU holographic display materializes before you. "Welcome to the Automation Playground, do you consent to biometric identification?". Assuming this is the way to attend class, you nod. The display shows a thumbs up: "Lesson commencing".

The presentation begins, showing how the complexity of the machines comes not from intricate designs, but from the simple, programmable nature of these drones. Following basic rules and predictable patterns, these devices orchestrate an elaborate dance of tasks and functions. Every movement and decision is clearly signaled, creating a harmony that mimics organic precision.

When the lesson finally ends, one of the drones descends and hovers in front of you. Its lights pulsate softly, indicating that it is in idle mode. The words "Following" shimmer around it. It seems you've acquired a new companion.

**Unlocked: You gain the ability to send your "pet" drone to any area. It can deliver items to their designated recipients and retrieve items intended for you.**
