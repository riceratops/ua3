This morning you feel grumpy and uncomfortable, itching all over your legs and arms. Perhaps you are allergic to something growing in the groove. Also, it's been a while since you last meditated and you're out of mushrooms. All you have is this stupid healing potion.

Stepping into the circlevator, you request Area 2 and feel the annoying hum as the system transports you around the ring of the station. When you arrive, a scene of chaos unfolds before you: drones maneuvering everywhere, and mechanisms interacting with irregular rhythms and screeches that pierce your ears.

**Dad is here.**

He looks at you in a way that makes you uncomfortable, like he's judging you. One of the drones approaches. "Delivery for RTD". He opens the container and takes out a healing potion. Someone is playing favorites, you might say.

A friendly UWU holographic display materializes before you. "Welcome to the Automation Playground, do you consent to biometric identification?". Assuming this is the way to attend class, you nod. The display shows a thumbs up: "Lesson commencing".

The presentation begins, showing how the complexity of the machines comes not from intricate designs, but from the simple, programmable nature of these drones. Following basic rules and predictable patterns, these devices orchestrate an elaborate dance of tasks and functions. Every movement and decision is clearly signaled, creating a harmony that mimics organic precision.

When the lesson finally ends, one of the drones descends and hovers in front of you. Its lights pulsate softly, indicating that it is in idle mode. The words "Following" shimmer around it. It seems you've acquired a new companion.

**Unlocked: You gain the ability to send your "pet" drone to any area. It can deliver items to their designated recipients and retrieve items intended for you.**

NERD BONUS

The relentless noise here is maddening, but no one is watching and you have plenty of room in your bag for a new gadget. You look for something to block the hatch in the dorm.

You see spare parts here and there, and you recognize some of them. After some tinkering, you put together a short-range remote control. You try it out on several machines and you can turn them on and off from a distance.

Back in the common area, you check to see if the hatch is detected by your invention, and it appears in the list of nearby devices. So does your drone, but you don't want to turn it off. You grin, thinking of all the nasty things you could do with this.

**You gain: A remote switch**
