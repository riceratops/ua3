You point the prototype at the sky through the dome in the common area. Today it measures 3 times the background light from of previous days. You wonder why it is fluctuating. 

It's important to make sure the detector isn't stolen, or any of your belongings. You put them all in Peaches' container.

But without a set destination, the lid won't close.  That's when you have a brilliant idea, a Plan B. You program her to deliver the items to Dot in an area... hmm... hopefully free of students. Number 9! She beeps and flies away.

**You lose: The master key, the light detector made with perovskite.**

You leave to area 7. The door opens onto an aquamarine expanse of islands surrounded by vibrant coral and algae.

It's an environment devoted entirely to aquatic flora. The waves are gigantic due to the low gravity, which already seems to be wreaking havoc. From time to time, large spheres of water cross the room and bounce off the dome. Perhaps it is for the better that Peaches is not here.

To move around, Instructor Molpe recommends that students wear the mermaid suits provided. When you put yours on, you feel comfortable and you wish that all areas were as fun as this one. Besides, swimming is fun.

Anyway, you learn about the qualities of various aquatic plants, from decorative water lilies to microscopic phytoplankton, and how the sunlight on this moon is too dim for any of them to grow healthy. Molpe liked it better when the station was closer to the Sun.

There are empty vials at the exit gate, you take one.

**You gain: empty vial**

Later in your room, you reunite with Peaches. She sadly reports that the delivery was unsuccessful.

**Recovered: Master key, light detector.**
