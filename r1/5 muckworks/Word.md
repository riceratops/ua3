5 - MUCKWORKS

You step into the circlevator and punch number 5, Muckworks. The ride over is quick, and when the doors open, you're hit with a strong, earthy smell. Unlike your classmates who wrinkle their noses, you find the scent oddly comforting.

Dr. Harlow, wearing a clean lab coat, greets everyone with a serious look. Reading the room, she gets right to the point, explaining the manure processing system with a straightforward approach. As she walks you through the facility, she details how this recycling operation is vital for the station's sustainability.

You're more engaged than the others, who seem eager to get away from the smell. Dr. Harlow talks about how they turn waste into something useful, and you appreciate the importance of recycling in maintaining life on the station.

At the end of the tour, Dr. Harlow shows off some blue vials on a shelf. These are made from byproducts and help keep the conducts clean.

While your classmates hurry out, you take a moment to look at the vials more closely. The texture catches your interest, and you pocket one of them.

**You gain: A blue potion**
