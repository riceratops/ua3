# round 1

Stepping into the circlevator, you request area 7, and it whisks you quickly around the ring. The door opens onto an aquamarine expanse of islands and surrounded by vibrant coral and algae.

It's an environment devoted entirely to aquatic flora, with no fish or other animals in sight. The waves are gigantic due to the low gravity, which already seems to be wreaking havoc. From time to time, large spheres of water cross the room and bounce off the dome.

To move around, Instructor Molpe recommends that students wear the mermaid suits provided. When you put yours on, you feel uncomfortable and can't wait to take it off. Besides, if this little instructor can swim without one, you certainly won't need one.

Anyway, you learn about the qualities of various aquatic plants, from decorative water lilies to microscopic phytoplankton, and how the sunlight on this moon is too dim for any of them to grow healthy.

BONUS FOR BEING PRETTY

Eventually, you ditch the cumbersome mermaid suit and try to get around without it. You dive deep into the water, touch the bottom, and swim up so fast that you end up flying, cutting one of the bubbles in half and touching the ceiling of the dome before diving back in. Your classmates clap and Molpe gives you a plumeria flower necklace.

**You gain: plumeria flowers**

There are empty vials at the exit gate, you grab one just in case.

**You gain: empty vial**
