You enter the circlevator, set your destination to Area 1, and are carried swiftly around the station's ring. As the doors slide open, you're greeted by the vibrant scenery of a jungle. You find a class about to begin, surrounded by the rich, earthy scent of damp leaves.

**Cespar is here.**

The teacher, Professor Luzia, gathers everyone and begins to lead the group deeper into the jungle. She points out various plants, noting that they all originate from Earth. From time to time, she gives you a curious look that makes you feel a little self-conscious.

As you follow along, your attention drifts to the myriad sticks scattered about and the various scents that fill the air. The excitement of exploring these distractions is palpable.

As the class draws to a close, Professor Luzia extends an invitation to everyone. "Next time, bring your own vials", she instructs. "We'll be exploring how to extract and combine these plants into more complex products. I'll provide the secondary ingredients."

**Unlocked: Visit area 1 again with a vial and the main component of a potion.**

You leave the area, fascinated by the plants and already planning what kind of vials to bring on your next visit. Your fans and followers didn't find it all that interesting.
