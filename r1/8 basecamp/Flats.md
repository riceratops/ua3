You enter the circlevator and punch in number 8. Moments later, the door opens to a vast area of buildings, some clearly modern human laboratories and observatories, others with the familiar circular shape of the temples your clan dedicates to meditation.

With scholars and students alike wandering about, the campus is a hive of activity. Your class is in one of the datarooms, designed to search every aspect of human knowledge. 

As the lecture begins, your professor is discussing the strategies that can be used to effectively navigate through the complexities of academic research. You are overwhelmed by the galaxy of interconnected nodes, each a topic of study and discovery. The most recent ones are related to Jupiter, the giant planet that is fixed in the sky.

The lesson is rich with insights into hypothesis formulation, data collection, and the importance of peer review. The campus' collaborative spirit is evident, with emphasis on using the various labs available to students.

**Unlocked: You can return to Area 8 and attempt a scientific discovery.**

Your followers didn't seem engaged. They were more interested in naming all the moons visible up there.
