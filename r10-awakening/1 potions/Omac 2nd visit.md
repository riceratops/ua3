Steven follows you to the circlevator, where you press number 1 to return to the Groove.

Moments later, Flatwoods joins you. "Hoff is not coming, she didn't want to leave Word alone", he tells you. He seems very distracted as he walks behind you. You were supposed to stand back to back!

The earthy and floral smells of this place are fantastic, you fantasize about building a garden like this one at home, now that you know it's possible. But you must not be distracted, you look back to make sure Flats and Steven are still there.

You give your vial and the mushroom to Professor Luzia. She greets you, but notices that you are in defensive mode. "You seem troubled, children. Come with me, I'll explain". She leads you to an enclosed garden where a cauldron is bubbling next to a distillation station, equipped with a glass alembic. Drying racks hold an assortment of herbs.

After some rather instructive cooking, she gives you a blue potion. "Pencilvia needs a lot of these potions outside of the station. They are probably cleaning the ruins they found and preparing them for gardening. Same three steps as always: heal the soil, scoop the manure, plant the seeds".

Just what you needed to know! You need these three things if you want to farm properly. 

Your fans are urging you to send the healing potion to Pen. They're right, that's why you came here, after all. You place the potion in Steven's container and send it away to area 6. Some fans cheer, while other complain that cooking classes are boring. You ban the loudest ones.

JUDGEMENT

Flats says that a shuttle from your clan has arrived for the graduation ceremony and everyone is gathering in the common area, including teachers. 

You see a group of representatives of The Harmony. They wear the traditional robe, and you recognize some of them. You see Hoff, Word, Dad and the two nerds chatting with Alice.

Suddenly, behind you, two werewolves in feral form stomp in, carrying a lot of healing potions and growling nonsense because they both have a piece of wood in their mouths, one of them is purple and the other is dark gray. You know it's Shadow and Cespar because you remember playing with these wolves when you were cubs, before you learned to control your primal urges. They have lost our way, what a dishonor to the clan!

You have done well, and the clan is proud of you. Your fans are celebrating.

(You win)
