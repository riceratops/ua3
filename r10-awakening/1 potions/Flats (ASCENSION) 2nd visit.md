You look at your bag. An empty vial, a mushroom, and a healing potion. You consider the possibility of having Luzia prepare a second potion and send them both to Pen, but meditating is too tempting. You send Buzzy away with the potion and put the mushroom in your mouth. 

You breathe in and out, in and out, looking deep into your mind, then into Harmony. In and out.

This time is different, HUNDREDS of powerful presences are manifesting. It feels like their energy can't reach you and you are in control. This time around, you control who merges with you, and in return you see what they see.

You merge with one of the stronger ones. It is Hoff. She is meditating near Word. You separate from her mind and jump to Word, and you see Hoff through Word's eyes. You then jump to another strong presence, this time is Dad. Through Dad's eyes you see him arrive to Fungus Town.

Moments later, the circlevator arrives at the common area, still smelling of Dad. You press number 1. Omac is waiting for you in the Groove, and you tell him that Hoff is not coming. Omac is not meditating like you are, so he gives his mushroom to Luzia.

Still merged with Dad's mind. He recognizes you and he also sees what you see. He approaches Dot, MMLH and Alice, along with other students who are learning the song, and you jump to MMLH's mind when she eats a mushroom. Then to Dot's mind. Dot is as powerful as Alice, Dad, Hoff and Word, and you are all in control, jumping from one mind to mind, seeing through each other's eyes. But Alice won't let you in, she gently pushes you away.

There are hundreds of others. As you merge with each of them, you feel calm and silence, but see nothing but darkness. Who are they, why didn't you sense them before, and where are they?

"You seem troubled, children", says Professor Luzia, "come with me, I'll explain". Omac and you follow her to to the garden you with the cauldron, still cautious and looking behind your backs.

As she cooks a healing potion, she tells you about an ongoing operation outside. "Pencilvia needs a lot of these potions outside of the station. They are probably cleaning the ruins they found and preparing them for gardening. Same three steps as always: heal the soil, scoop the manure, plant the seeds".

You are losing subscribers, they were expecting a fight, or something dangerous, and because they don't see what you see, they merely witnessed a walk and a cooking class...

EVALUATION

You return to the common area. A shuttle from your clan has arrived for the graduation ceremony, and you see through Hoff's eyes that everyone is gathering there, including some teachers. Through Dot's eyes you see her sharing the circlevator with Dad and Alice.

You approach the group of representatives of The Harmony, who are seeing this station for the first time. They wear the traditional robe.  

Suddenly, behind you, two werewolves in feral form stomp in, carrying a lot of healing potions and growling nonsense because they both have a piece of wood in their mouths, one of them is purple and the other is dark gray. Your first impulse is to throw the dirt from outside in their direction. After the dirt hits the white one, you realize it's Shadow, and the other one is Cespar.

You remember playing with these wolves as cubs, before you were taught how to control your primal urges. They have lost our way, what a dishonor to the clan!

You have done well, and the clan is proud of you. Your fans are celebrating.
