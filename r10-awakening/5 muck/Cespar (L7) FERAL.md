When you wake up, your perch is shattered and so is the bed. You kiss your pyrite crystal and embrace the growing rage. 

You step into the circlevator and punch number 5, Muckworks. The ride over is quick, and when the doors open, you're hit with a strong, earthy smell. Unlike your classmates who wrinkle their noses, you find the scent oddly comforting.

**Shadow is here, in feral form.**

A drone hovers at the entrance. "Deliver for Shadow", it announces. She opens it, picking up flowers and placing them on her head, in between her long ears. She has soft dark fur and a very interesting scent. 

The human students approach, trying to touch you, but you respond with a loud roar, scaring them away. Shadow swings a stick at them. A beautiful, perfect stick. You can't help but grab it with your fangs.

Dr. Harlow, wearing a clean lab coat, runs in, wondering what all the fuss is about. She asks everyone to gather around her for the lesson, but you two are fighting over the stick. The group walks through the facility without you.

You jump, fall on each other playing, and at some point, Shadow's flowers fall into a canal of brown water. Immediately, a garden begins to grow, clogging the canal. The stick finally breaks, and each of you keeps a piece in your mouth.

Dr. Harlow shows up with blue vials and pours the healing liquid into the water. "Stop it, you two! This is not a playground or a garden, you should not be throwing seeds in here!". 

She has healing potions!? You take some from a storage room and leave the place. You hear the teacher complain, "You'd better give those to Pen!", she suggests, "We're recycling them because there aren't enough mushrooms for the operations she's running outside".

SHOWDOWN

Shadow and you return to the common area, happy with your pieces of wood. As soon as you get off the circlevator, you see that a group of representatives of your clan has arrived at the station, all of them wearing the traditional robes. They give you a look of disapproval that you haven't seen since you were a cub, when you were still learning to meditate.

(But, technically, you won!)
