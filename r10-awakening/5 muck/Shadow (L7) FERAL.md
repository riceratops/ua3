You wake up in a trashed bed, but it doesn't matter. Time to wreak some more havoc.

First, you put the list of usernames and an empty vial in your drone and program it to make the delivery to Dad... No, wait, a delivery to Shadowcat in area 6.

Next, you step into the circlevator and punch number 5, Muckworks. The ride is quick, and when the doors open, you're hit with a strong, earthy smell. Unlike your classmates who wrinkle their noses, you find the scent oddly comforting. 

**Cespar is here, in feral form.**

A drone hovers at the entrance. "Deliver for Shadow", it announces. You open it and pick up the bouquet of flowers he got from the Groove. You place them on your head and smile to Cespar. He has soft purple fur and a very interesting scent. 

The human students approach and try to touch you, but Cespar responds with a loud roar, scaring them away. You swing your stick at them menacingly, trying to actually hit them in their stupid faces. Cespar grabs it firmly with his fangs and tries to take it away from you. Is he with them?

Dr. Harlow, wearing a clean lab coat, runs in, wondering what all the fuss is about. She asks everyone to gather around her for the lesson, but you two are fighting over the stick. The group walks through the facility without you.

You jump, fall on each other fighting, and Cespar breaks one of the pipes. The stick finally splits, and each of you keeps a piece in your mouth.

Dr. Harlow shows up with blue vials and pours the liquid into a canal with brown water. "Stop it, you two! This is not a playground or a garden, you should not be throwing seeds in here!". That's when you realize that your flowers have fallen off and are growing in front of your eyes, clogging the canal.

She has healing potions!? You take some from a storage room and leave the place. You hear the teacher complain, "You'd better give those to Pen!", she suggests, "We're recycling them because there aren't enough mushrooms for the operations she's running outside".

SHOWDOWN

Cespar and you return to the common area, happy with your pieces of wood. As soon as you get off the circlevator, you see that a group of representatives of your clan has arrived at the station, all of them wearing the traditional robes. They give you a look of disapproval that you haven't seen since you were a cub, when you were still learning to meditate.

With them, and among other students, you see Dad, wearing a wig and smiling, giving you a thumbs up. The plan must have worked. 

(You won!)

A small piece of mud lands in your face. You don't see who threw it.
