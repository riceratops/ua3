You continue to feel the same hundreds of presences as before. Alice, Dad, and you are in control, checking from time to time to see if any of the other beings have opened their eyes. 

You merge with one of the stronger ones. It is Flats. He is eating a mushroom in a garden. You separate from his mind and jump to Hoff, and you see yourself through her eyes. You also sense that Dad, Dot, MMLH and Alice are singing together. You are now SIX strong minds in control: Alice, Dad, Hoff, Dot, Flats and you.

EVALUATION

A shuttle from your clan has arrived for the graduation ceremony, and you see that everyone is gathering there, including some teachers. Through Dad's eyes you see her sharing the circlevator with Dot and Alice.

You approach the group of representatives of The Harmony, who are seeing this station for the first time. They wear the traditional robe. 

You have endured this adventure well, and the clan is proud of you. Now, they will take you home.
