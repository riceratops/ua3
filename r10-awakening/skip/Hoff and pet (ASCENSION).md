You breathe in and out, in and out, looking deep into your mind, then into Harmony. In and out.

This time is different, HUNDREDS of powerful presences are manifesting. It feels like their energy can't reach you and you are in control. This time around, you control who merges with you, and in return you see what they see.

You merge with one of the stronger ones. It is Flats. He is eating a mushroom in a garden. You separate from his mind and jump to Word, and you see yourself through her eyes. You then jump to another strong presence, this time is Dad. Through Dad's eyes you see him arrive to Fungus Town.

Still merged with Dad's mind. He recognizes you and he also sees what you see. He approaches Dot, MMLH and Alice, along with other students who are learning the song, and you jump to MMLH's mind when she eats a mushroom. Then to Dot's mind. Dot is as powerful as Alice, Dad, Flats and Word, and you are all in control, jumping from one mind to mind, seeing through each other's eyes. But Alice won't let you in, she gently pushes you away.

There are hundreds of others. As you merge with each of them, you feel calm and silence, but see nothing but darkness. Who are they, why didn't you sense them before, and where are they?

You are losing subscribers, they were expecting a showdown, or something dangerous, but they only see the wall...
