MMLH, her drone, Peaches, Blueberry and you form a small army of five that can barely fit into the circlevator. "The light detector reads 6, brace yourselves", you warn them. Blueberry seems confused.

When you arrive in Fungus Town, Alice is chatting with one of the pretty. 

**Shadow is here.**

A drone arrives with a delivery for Shadow, from which she takes an empty vial and a piece of paper. If that's for a potion, she has fallen behind.

Alice invites you all to pick a mushroom and join her. She teaches Shadow the song of Zenphony, and you start to hum it as well. The mushroom takes effect.

This time is different, HUNDREDS of powerful presences are manifesting. It feels like their energy can't reach you and you are in control. This time around, you control who merges with you, and in return you see what they see. You merge with one of the stronger ones. It is Hoff. She is meditating near Word. You separate from her mind and jump to Word, and you see Hoff through Word's eyes. You then jump to another strong presence, this time is Flats. Through Flat's eyes you see him arrive to the Verdant Groove with Omac.

There are many others. As you merge with each of them, you feel calm and silence, but see nothing but darkness. Who are they, why didn't you sense them before, and where are they? At one point, you see yourself through MMLH's eyes. 

"Close your eyes", you whisper to her. When she does it, you still see yourself, so that's not it. The poor souls must be in a dark place, or perhaps they are blind?

After the lesson, yet another drone arrives. "Delivery for Pencilvia from Flatwoods". Alice says "Yes, that's me".

"I knew it!", says MMLH. You give Pen a healing potion and she congratulates Shadow and you on completing the assignments.

"Hold on...", says Shadow, "If you are Seer Pencilvia, does it mean that we are all seers now?". She laughs. "Who is we, Shadow?". What a mysterious woman.

SHOWDOWN

Alice returns to the common area after you. A shuttle from your clan has arrived for the graduation ceremony, and you see through Word's eyes that everyone is gathering there, including some teachers.

You approach the group of representatives of The Harmony, who are seeing this station for the first time. They wear the traditional robe and you recognize famous scientists and mentors among them.

Two werewolves in feral form stomp in, carrying a lot of healing potions and growling nonsense because they both have a piece of wood in their jaws, one of them is purple and the other is dark gray. You see Flats panic and throw something in their direction. 

You remember playing with these wolves as cubs, before you were taught how to control your primal urges. These are Cespar and a copy of Shadow. They have lost our way and given to chaos, what a dishonor to the clan!  

One could say that 6 dots are not that many, but two shadows are one too many.

Anyway, despite not finding any other doors to break open, you can be very proud of your achievements.
