You continue to feel the same hundreds of presences as before. Alice, Word, and you are in control, checking from time to time to see if any of the other beings have opened their eyes. 

You arrange the flowers into an elaborate crown and send it to Shadow in Area 5, hoping it will make her happy. Then, as planned, you replace the name on your suit with hers, and put on a wig and some makeup. You are unrecognizable, a master of disguise!

As soon as you arrive in Fungus Town, Alice greets you. "Welcome RTD!". You realize now that this is not going to work.

"No, I'm not him", you say, like a liar. She nods quietly, but you sense her mind trying to merge with yours. She pushes, but you don't let her in. 

Other students arrive, including the nerds.

**Dot and MMLH are here.**

They have three drones following them, and are playing with some gadgets as they walk back to back. A fourth drone arrives and announces "Delivery for Shadowcat". You say, in a high-pitched voice, "Yes, that's me". Alice observes you, visibly amused.

Someone has sent Shadow an empty vial and a piece of paper with a series of letters, arranged in groups of 9. The first group says "USERNAMES", the rest appear to be names of teachers with additional letters. You take the paper away before Alice sees it, wondering what Shadow is up to.

The teacher invites you all to pick a mushroom and join her. She will teach you the song of Zenphony again, which you no longer need, but you play along. The mushroom has no effect on you, but you hum the song to complete the charade.

When MMLH and Dot take their mushrooms, you sense Dot's presence very strongly. Now that you pay attention, you are now SIX strong minds in control: Alice, Word, Hoff, Dot, Flats and you.

After the lesson, yet another drone arrives. "Delivery for Pencilvia from Flatwoods". To your surprise, Alice says "Yes, that's me".

"I knew it!", says MMLH. Dot gives her a healing potion and Alice says "thank you very much Dot, congratulations". She then turns to you. "And you, Shadow, congratulations".

"Hold on...", you think out loud, "If you are Seer Pencilvia, does it mean that we are all seers now?". She laughs. "Who is we, Shadow? tell me".

SHOWDOWN

You return to the common area. A shuttle from your clan has arrived for the graduation ceremony, and you see through Word's eyes that everyone is gathering there, including some teachers.

You approach the group of representatives of The Harmony, who are seeing this station for the first time. They wear the traditional robe.

Shadow and Cespar stomp in, carrying a lot of healing potions and growling nonsense because they both have a piece of wood in their mouths. Shadow looks at you, so you give her a thumbs up to signal that the plan worked.

(You win)
