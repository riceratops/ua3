On your way to the Fungus Town, Dot warns you: "The light detector reads 6, brace yourselves". When you arrive in Fungus Town, Alice is chatting with one of the pretty. 

**Shadow is here.**

A drone arrives with a delivery for Shadow, from which she takes an empty vial and a piece of paper. You check at your remote and it says that it is Shadow's drone. Why is she sending stuff to herself?

Alice invites you all to pick a mushroom and join her. She teaches Shadow the song of Zenphony, and you start to hum it as well. The mushroom takes effect.

This time is different, HUNDREDS of powerful presences are manifesting. There are SIX strong ones that overwhelm your senses.

"Close your eyes", Dot whispers, and you try that. It doesn't help to lessen the overwhelming feeling. Hopefully the effect of the mushroom will pass. You feel calm, so that part of the plan worked.

After the lesson, yet another drone arrives. "Delivery for Pencilvia from Flatwoods". Alice says "Yes, that's me".

"I knew it!", you exclaim. Dot gives Pen anothe potion and she congratulates her. Your remote confirms that this is from Flats.

"Hold on...", says Shadow, "If you are Seer Pencilvia, does it mean that we are all seers now?". Pen laughs. "Who is we, Shadow?". What a mysterious woman.

SHOWDOWN

Pen returns to the common area after you. Dot says that a shuttle from your clan has arrived for the graduation ceremony, and everyone is gathering there, including some teachers.

You see a group of representatives of The Harmony. They wear the traditional robe, and you recognize some of them. 

Two werewolves in feral form stomp in, carrying a lot of healing potions and growling nonsense because they both have a piece of wood in their jaws, one of them is purple and the other is dark gray. 

You remember playing with these wolves as cubs, before you were taught how to control your primal urges. These are Cespar and another of the pretty. They have lost our way and given to chaos, what a dishonor to the clan! 

(You survived! You win!)
