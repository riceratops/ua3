You use the circlevator to visit area 4. As the door opens, the air around you forms a white cloud as it freezes, and your skin and eyes get colder before your suit automatically forms a protective mask over your face. The atmosphere of this moon is thin and too cold to hold any water.

The unexpected freeze made you really angry. You growl uncontrollably and stretch your arms and legs, the annoying itch from before turning to pleasure as you grow hair everywhere. Your bones creak audibly as they realign and you transform into your feral form. You are the shame of your clan and as far from their teachings as one can get.

The dock is a large area of the station's ring, with drones flying in and out of huge containers. You get distracted as your instincts urge you to run behind them, but you control yourself. 

A group of students looks at you. One of them exclaims "COOL!". You follow them into one of the buildings. 

The sound of machines fills the air. Inside, you meet Professor Nekane, an elderly woman.

"Sometimes I get a delivery from Pen with a blue potion and I have to go to the excavation in area 0 to pour the liquid into a tank, but I don't know what it's for. I only care about the rocks, I swear!".

As you walk away, she composes herself again. "That's it, I don't want to see you beasts again. I'm going to tell them that you all took this class".
