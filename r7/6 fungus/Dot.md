As you suspected, today's reading is less than 3, but still greater than 2.

You put all of your precious belongings in the container and tell Peaches to do a delivery to you. As soon as you press number 1, she beeps, closes her container and flies away with everything.

Your heart stops for a moment, but then remember that she would not open her container for a stranger.

A bit worried for her, you make your way to Fungus Town via the circlevator. 

As the doors slide open, you enter a cavern where the walls themselves emit a natural glow from orange and blue bioluminescent mycelia and other organisms. The floor is somewhat slippery and uneven. As you move away from the entrance, you hear faint music that grows louder as you descend further through the tunnels.

Todayâ€™s guide, Alice, greets you and invites you to pick mushrooms from a nearby circle where they grow. She's dressed in dark clothes and her face is painted with colors that reflect the light from the walls, and you can see her wrinkles of happiness as she plays her music.

"Today I will teach you the power of ZENPHONY", Alice explains, "which is the art of meditating while moving". She eats one of the mushrooms and continues to play her music. You put one of yours in your mouth and imitate her dance. 

Everything now seems connected, you feel awake, aware of what she is explaining. You learn about the organisms that multiply here without any sunlight, how useful they are as a material and as nutrient, so it makes sense that the university is planning to build a cave just like this one under the station. In fact, everything makes sense. You feel so conscious of this moment.

You can now look into yourself with your mind, then into the Harmony, as you have been taught all your life. But you don't need to stop what you are doing, you don't need a quiet place, you are your own temple. The only thing that disturbs you is that you feel four presences: Two of them feel stronger than the other two, so you assume that one of them is Alice. Who are the others?

**You gain: 1 blue mushroom.**

**Unlocked: You can eat a blue mushroom to meditate without losing your turn.**

Back in the room, Peaches is waiting for you here because she couldn't find you in the other area.

You feel calm again. She is fine, you are relaxed, and all your items are back.
