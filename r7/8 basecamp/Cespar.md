You place your mushroom and the empty vial in your drone's container and program it to make a delivery to Professor Luzia. The moment you press number 1, it closes and flies away. You head to the library.

You enter the circlevator and punch in number 8. Moments later, the door opens to a vast area of buildings, some clearly modern human laboratories and observatories, others with the familiar circular shape of the temples your clan dedicates to meditation.

With scholars and students alike wandering about, the campus is a hive of activity. Your class is in one of the datarooms, designed to search every aspect of human knowledge. 

As the lecture begins, your professor is discussing the strategies that can be used to effectively navigate through the complexities of academic research. You are overwhelmed by the galaxy of interconnected nodes, each a topic of study and discovery. The most recent ones are related to Jupiter, the giant planet that is fixed in the sky.

The lesson is rich with insights into hypothesis formulation, data collection, and the importance of peer review. The campus' collaborative spirit is evident, with emphasis on using the various labs available to students.

**Unlocked: You can return to Area 8 and attempt a scientific discovery.**

You take a moment to look up information about your red flower. It's called "celosia argenta" and there are several articles published about its culinary, medicinal, and decorative uses. There are publications on human symbolism, linking it to love, strength and health, but you don't have time to read through them now. Maybe next time.

Back in your room, the drone hovers near your perch, reporting a successful delivery. You take a blue potion from it.
