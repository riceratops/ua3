The circlevator takes you quickly to the Xeno Garden, where a special kind of biology is studied. These organisms resemble plants, but their cells are nothing like plants, and they are all purple because they share a common ancestor.

Your drone is following you. The best bodyguard.

The area is full of warnings. Do not touch, do not inhale, do not do anything. Miss Edurne, the old teacher who welcomes the students here, repeats the warnings and adds, "There used to be a hands-on session as part of this course, but a student got hurt". 

All the samples are behind transparent walls. They really look like plants, but a plant would not thrive in lava or frozen methane, so the whole visit challenges your understanding of evolution. The last lesson before leaving is an exhibit of an organism with tongue-like leaves that dance to music. They were discovered by Pencilvia half a century ago.

You ask about this mysterious woman's whereabouts. Miss Edurne winks and gives you a sterilised vial.

**You gain: an empty vial**

POPULAR BONUS

"She was a popular singer, you know? Even as a student, she had far more followers than you, but what she really liked was teaching, so she changed her name".

"Wait, are you... Pencilvia?", you suddenly realize. She laughs. "No... no... but good thinking! You know...", she hesitates, "I've said too much already, thanks for the visit, Flats, you're doing great".

ATTENDANCE UPDATE

Back in your room, you check your attendance sheet. It says that you attended all classes except for area 5. You don't remember going to area 4, who went to the Rock Dock on your behalf?

You feel uneasy and grumpy. It's been a while since you've had a break.
