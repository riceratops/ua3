After breakfast, you decide to explore those presences you sense during meditation.

**Word and MMLH are here with their drones.**

You sit close to Word and begin to relax. 

MEDITATION

You breathe and look within yourself with your mind, then into the Harmony, as usual. 

This time is different, four powerful presences are manifesting. It feels like their energy can't reach you and you are in control. This time around, you control who merges with you, you control what they can see of you and in return you see what they see.

You merge with Word's mind. She is very calm and physicaly besides you. Then you separate from Word and merge with the next one. It is MMLH. She is meditating near her room.

Next, you separate from MMLH and merge with Dot. She is eating a mushroom with Alice and learning the song of zenphony. 

Then you try to merge with what you assume is Alice, but she is stronger than the others and gently pushes you away.

ATTENDANCE UPDATE

Back in your room, you check your attendance sheet. It says that you attended all classes except for areas 1 and 3. You don't remember going to area 4, who went to the Rock Dock on your behalf?
