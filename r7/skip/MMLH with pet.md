With plenty of time left for your tasks, you decide to skip class and stay in the common area after breakfast. Your drone is following you.

**Dad and Word are here with their drones.**

You consider turning off their drones, but they've  seen you here and you don't want to escalate the already tense situation. You find a quiet place. It's been a while since your last meditation session, and this quiet moment helps you refocus and recharge, preparing you for the days ahead.

MEDITATION

As you look within yourself with your mind, then into the Harmony, as you have been taught all your life, four powerful presences manifest. It feels like their energy is merging with yours. This is what you felt with the mushrooms. Two of the presences are stronger than the other two, and you can't tell which one is Alice.

You feel calm, deeply at peace.

ATTENDANCE UPDATE

Back in your room, you check your attendance sheet. It says that you attended all classes except for areas 3 and 5. You don't remember going to area 4, who went to the Rock Dock on your behalf?
