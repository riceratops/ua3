The bullies open the hatch and you are thrown out into the thin atmosphere outside the school.

After a moment that feels painfully cold, your suit activates. A protective mask forms over your face, and you can breathe again. You continue a short, slow fall toward Callisto's surface, and when you touch the ground, the surface crunches softly under your boots. You grab a bit of the ground. It's icy and crumbles easily in your hand. The small chunks glitter faintly in the light.

**You gain: Some dirt from outside**

You look up at the exterior of the station. It's like a huge wall and you can't see the domes from here. Around you, the craters cast long shadows as the sun approaches the horizon. Above you, the planet, its colorful bands standing out against two of its gray moons.

Determination takes over and you start walking, looking for a way out of this damn place. If you remember correctly, the shuttle bay was somewhere around the perimeter. Mr. Fluffyface II flies in and follows you. Is he also tired of stupid bullies?

You start to worry when you can't find the shuttle, but you don't want to go back to the station. After the sun sets, you see the trail of drones flying to the nearby crater. Curious, you come up with a clever plan: You hold on to your companion with all your strength and press number 0.

"Weeee!"... 

As you fly over the edge of the crater, you see where the drones are headed: a perfectly circular structure shaped like a zero. In its center, a hole plunges deep into the ground. The inner walls seem to stretch down forever into the abyss, and the drones, instead of descending, are clearing the area around the building. Your journey ends at a door. There are no shuttles in sight, so you enter.

Inside, you can breathe easily. The chamber reminds you of an old temple you had back in your colony, but it has more intricate engravings and the symbols are foreign to you. In another chamber, you discover a human machine pumping a blue liquid into a pipe that leads to other chambers. This is the same blue from the mushroom and the potion you had. Look, there is another one right here.

**You gain: A blue potion.**

You look into the next chamber to see where the pipe leads. There is a huge sarcophage in the shape of a werewolf, and the pipe splits and goes into it. The next chamber is exactly the same, and this seems to repeat all the way around the building.

Will you go back to the station, share what you have learned, and continue playing? You should be back in time to harass Omac.

Or will you end it here and appear in the finale?
