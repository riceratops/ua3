You enter the circlevator and punch in number 8. Moments later, the door opens to a vast area of buildings, some clearly modern human laboratories and observatories, others with the familiar circular shape of the temples your clan dedicates to meditation.

With scholars and students alike wandering about, the campus is a hive of activity. Your class is in one of the datarooms, designed to search every aspect of human knowledge. 

Hoff's drone flies in. "BEEP. Delivery for Omac". There is a blue mushroom in its container.  Your followers are divided. Some want you to keep it, others dare you to eat it. 

It actually tastes better than it smells. You take it all and soon you feel dizzy.

The lecture begins, your professor is discussing the strategies that can be used to effectively navigate through the complexities of academic research. You are overwhelmed by the galaxy of interconnected nodes, each a topic of study and discovery. You can barely pay attention, and the room is spinning, but you end up with access to the labs.

**Unlocked: You can return to Area 8 and attempt a scientific discovery.**

Some followers complain that you were too quiet. Others that you missed the sunset. You ban them. Eating the mushroom didn't work, and you're still anxious and grumpy.

ATTACKED

Back to the common area, as you open the door to your room, someone pushes you inside, face down. You feel a sharp pain in your neck and you lose consciousness. When you wake up, you are inside your room, with a light head and a lighter bag. Your drone seems unharmed, at least.

**You lose: Pallasite, empty vial.**
