You enter the circlevator, set your destination to Area 1, and are carried swiftly around the station's ring. As the doors slide open, you're greeted by the vibrant scenery of a jungle. You find a class about to begin, surrounded by the rich, earthy scent of damp leaves.

The teacher, Professor Luzia, gathers everyone and begins to lead the group deeper into the jungle. She points out various plants, noting that they all originate from Earth. From time to time, she gives you a curious look that makes you feel a little self-conscious.

As you follow along, your attention drifts to the myriad sticks scattered about and the various scents that fill the air. The excitement of exploring these distractions is palpable.

As the class draws to a close, Professor Luzia extends an invitation to everyone. "Next time, bring your own vials", she instructs. "We'll be exploring how to extract and combine these plants into more complex products. I'll provide the secondary ingredients."

**Unlocked: Visit area 1 again with a vial and the main component of a potion.**

"Before you go", she stops you, "we can use the mushroom I smell in your bag to make the potion for the assignment". 

You hesitate for a moment. You enjoyed eating it, but you also want to succeed, so you give it to her. She leads you to an enclosed garden where a cauldron bubbles next to a distillation station, equipped with a glass alembic. Drying racks hold an assortment of herbs.

After some rather instructive cooking, she gives you a blue potion, just like the one on the photo. "Did you know that Dr. Lerison?", you ask. She smiles. "I don't know sweety, I've had many lovers".

**You lose: vial and mushroom**

**You gain: A healing potion**

When the sun sets as predicted, you expect the star to turn red or do anything interesting, but it simply disappears behind the horizon.
