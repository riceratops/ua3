With plenty of time left for your tasks, you decide to skip class and stay in the common area after breakfast. 

**Dot is here.**

A drone is following Dot. It has yellow and orange stars painted on its side. When it sees your chicken drone, it hides behind Dot and beeps nervously.

You find a quiet place. It's been a while since your last meditation session, and this quiet moment helps you refocus and recharge, preparing you for the days ahead.

As you look within yourself with your mind, then into the Harmony, as you have been taught all your life, three powerful presences manifest. It feels like their energy is merging with yours. This connection deepens and you become one with them. Then silence.

You feel calm, deeply at peace, as you have never felt before.

When the sun sets as predicted, you expect the star to turn red or do anything interesting, but it simply disappears behind the horizon. Quite uneventful. 

You meet the others and ambush Omac when he is about to enter his room.
