With plenty of time left for your tasks, you decide to skip class and stay in the common area after breakfast. 

**Peaches, Cespar and his drone are here.**

His drone, fluttering behind him, has been sculpted by violent pecking. It bears an uncanny resemblance to a chicken, with a rudimentary beak tucked into its metal body. Peaches beeps and hides behind you.

You find a quiet place. It's been a while since your last meditation session, and this quiet moment helps you refocus and recharge, preparing you for the days ahead.

As you look within yourself with your mind, then into the Harmony, as you have been taught all your life, three powerful presences manifest. It feels like their energy is merging with yours. This connection deepens and you become one with them. Then silence.

You feel calm, deeply at peace, as you have never felt before.

When the sun sets as predicted, you expect the star to turn red or do anything interesting, but it simply disappears behind the horizon. Quite uneventful. You point the prototype at the sky and it still gives the same reading.
