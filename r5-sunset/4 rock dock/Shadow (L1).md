You use the circlevator to visit area 4. As the door opens, the air around you forms a white cloud as it freezes, and your skin and eyes get colder before your suit automatically forms a protective mask over your face. The atmosphere of this moon is thin and too cold to hold any water.

The dock is a large area of the station's ring, with drones flying in and out of huge containers. All the containers are labeled and connected to processing units that appear to be breaking rocks into smaller pieces. You also notice a display on the drones that shows a 0 when they go out and a 4 when they come back.

You follow a group of students into one of the buildings. The noise of machines fills the air. Inside, you meet Professor Nekane, an elderly but strong woman. "Welcome," she begins, gesturing to the collection in front of her. "Today we're going to study the unique geological formations created by meteorite impacts on Callisto. These include not only impact diamonds, but also pallasites with embedded olivine crystals, and tektites, which are glassy rocks formed from the debris of meteoric impacts."

Throughout the class, she shows you how to use the equipment to analyze these exotic materials, explaining the science behind their origins and what they can tell us about the history of this landscape. At the end of the lesson, you are encouraged to choose a gem or rock to analyze further. "Pick one to continue your study in a lab", she suggests. 

Some have metallic octahedral pieces with a shiny surface. They are similar to what was stolen from Word. 

**You gain: A beautiful magnetite**

When the sun sets as predicted, you expect the star to turn red or do anything interesting you could paint, but it simply disappears behind the horizon. Quite uneventful. In this darker landscape you can see the dim lights of the drones in the distance. They are flying to and from the same hole in a nearby crater.

You are still feeling anxious and grumpy. It has been a while since you have meditated, and all the hustle and bustle of classes and bullying is getting to you. Throwing rocks didn't help. Maybe harassing Omac will.
