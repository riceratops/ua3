Last night, naked in the privacy of your room, you passionately railed against the Teacher in spontaneous songs, captivating your viewers who eagerly await your next stream.

You request area 7, and the circlevator whisks you around the ring. The door opens onto an aquamarine expanse of islands surrounded by vibrant coral and algae.

It's an environment devoted entirely to aquatic flora, with no fish or other animals in sight. The waves are gigantic due to the low gravity, which already seems to be wreaking havoc. From time to time, large spheres of water cross the room and bounce off the dome.

**MMLH is here.**

(You contemplate catfishing her in disguise, but she recognizes you)

To move around, Instructor Molpe recommends that students wear the mermaid suits provided. When you put yours on, you feel uncomfortable and can't wait to take it off. Besides, if this little instructor can swim without one, you certainly won't need one.

Anyway, you learn about the qualities of various aquatic plants, from decorative water lilies to microscopic phytoplankton, and how the sunlight on this moon is too dim for any of them to grow healthy.

There are empty vials at the exit gate, you grab one just in case.

**You gain: empty vial**

Your fans were amused, but one complained that they could not see any of the pretty ones swimming. You ban her.
