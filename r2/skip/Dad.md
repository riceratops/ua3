With plenty of time left for your tasks, you decide to skip class and stay in the common area after breakfast. 

It's been a while since your last meditation session, and this quiet moment helps you refocus and recharge, preparing you for the days ahead.

As you look within yourself with your mind, then into the Harmony, as you have been taught all your life, three powerful presences manifest. It feels like their energy is merging with yours. This connection deepens and you become one with them. Then silence.

You feel calm, deeply at peace, as you have never felt before.
