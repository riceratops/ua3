Eager to be the first one to make a discovery, you return to the campus in Area 8 with a plan.

First, you browse through previous measurements and studies of jupiter and its moons. Overwhelmed by the amount of data, you narrow your search to observations made from Callisto, the moon you are on, and notice that, while there are computational models to help predict their movement, nobody has published an actual calendar of their positions in the sky. You decide to build one and base it on the standard sleeping cycles.

After compiling the data, you look up to check your predictions for today. You see Europa, Io, Amalthea, and Ganymede perfectly aligned with your chart. From here, the sun is in the same region of the sky, so each looks like a crescent.

Even better, your calendar predicts that the sun will be behind the planet tomorrow. An eclipse!

**Progress: You made a discovery**

Who needs peer reviews when they can simply look up, right?
