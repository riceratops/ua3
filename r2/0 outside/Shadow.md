Just as you had planned, you are thrown out into the thin atmosphere outside the school.

After a moment that feels painfully cold, your suit activates. A protective mask forms over your face, and you can breathe again. You continue a short, slow fall toward Callisto's surface, and when you touch the ground, the surface crunches softly under your boots. You grab a bit of the ground. It's icy and crumbles easily in your hand. The small chunks glitter faintly in the light.

**You gain: Some dirt from outside**

You look up at the exterior of the station. It is like a giant wall with no way to get back in. Around you, the landscape is icy and full of craters, well lit by the sun. Up above you can see the planet, its colorful bands standing out against its gray moons.

Your determination takes over and you start walking, looking for a way in. After an eternity, a someone inside spots you and lets you in, but you have already missed the second lesson.
